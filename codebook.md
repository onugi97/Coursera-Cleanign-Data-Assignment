## CodeBook
This code book lists the names of variables used in the run_analysis.r file to create a tidy data (tidyData.txt).  
Details on the raw data sets can be found in the features.txt file in the downloaded file.  The tidy data contain
total 68 columns. The 1st and 2nd columns ('subject' and 'activity') are factor variables, and the ramaing variables 
in the column 3-68 are measurements which were normalized).
